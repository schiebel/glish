This directory contains a port of the BSD make tool (from NetBSD)
I have run it on SunOS,Solaris,HP-UX 9 and IRIX.

Building is simply a matter of:

configure
make -f makefile.boot
make -f makefile.boot install

if you have GNU make or a make which supports VPATH, you can build it
in a separate directory:

here=`pwd`
mkdir /tmp/bmake
cd /tmp/bmake
$here/configure
gmake -f makefile.boot
gmake -f makefile.boot install

In bmake/mk I have provided a set of bsd.*.mk macros and a set of *.mk
macros which I now use since the bsd.* macros are only supported for
building /usr/src.  makefile.boot will install them in
/use/local/share/mk

bmake.0 is a pre-formatted copy of bmake.1

I have also provided tmac.shar which contains the BSD mandoc macros
and a man macro set that will pick whether to run andoc or an.old
If you do not have tmac.andoc and want it, then:

cd /usr/lib/tmac
mv tmac.an tmac.an.old
sh $here/tmac.shar

Note that if your man macros do not live in /usr/lib/tmac (ok for
SunOS), you can either make /usr/lib/tmac a symlink to the correct
directory or edit each of tmac.* appropriately.

bmake has a couple of variables built into it, MACHINE and MACHINE_ARCH

These are set in makefile.boot by the script machine.sh which
typically produces:

MACHINE=`uname -s`

or if the OS runs on multiple platforms

MACHINE=`uname -s`.`uname -m`

But `uname -m` may be either too general or too specific
Eg. on SunOS `arch` is more useful.
