This is Glish version 2.6.0, dated 14Nov97.

Installing Glish
----------------

The Glish system comes in three directories, "sds", "editline", and "glish".
To build the system you need a C++ compiler, sockets, an ANSI C compiler,
and flex 2.4.6 (or higher), which you can get from ftp.ee.lbl.gov.

1.  Unpack the Glish distribution and cd to the corresponding top-level
    directory.

2.  Setenv the $ARCH environment variable to reflect your architecture
    (the name isn't important but is used so you can build Glish for
    multiple architectures).  For example, "setenv $ARCH SUN4".

3.  If you want to force the use of a particular C or C++ compiler, set
    the $CC and $CXX environment variables (e.g., "setenv CXX g++").  On
    AIX and Solaris systems, if you have bison installed you should set
    $YACC to yacc, to avoid using bison (problems with alloca() declarations).
    If you have installed earlier versions of Glish, you may have the
    environment variable INSTALL set to "mv"; be sure to unset it!

4.  Type "./configure" to run the configuration script.  This creates
    (in the sundry subdirectories) Makefile and config.h files from
    Makefile.in and config.h.in files.  If the configuration process
    makes some incorrect deductions about your system, you can then
    edit these generated files to correct the problem.  (And let me
    know about the problem so I can see whether the configuration
    process can be modified to avoid it.)

5.  Type "make".  (On Solaris systems, you should use the stock "make"
    utility and not GNU "make".)  This makes all the components of the
    Glish system and installs the resulting libraries and executables
    into lib/$ARCH and bin/$ARCH.  On Sun systems, compiling the file system.c
    may result in slews of warnings about #define redefinitions; this is
    due to buggy system header files, but causes no harm.

6.  The configuration process has changed with Glish 2.5 and might have
    bugs in it.  If so, please send me email and I'll iron them out.
