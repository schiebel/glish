Glish is a language, interpreter, and class library for building
loosely-coupled distributed systems.  For an overview from a general
computing perspective, see the paper ``Glish: A User-Level Software
Bus for Loosely-Coupled Distributed Systems,'' in the Proceedings of
the 1993 USENIX Winter Technical Conference.  For an overview from
an accelerator control perspective, see the paper ``Glish: A Software
Bus for High-Level Control,'' Proceedings of the 1993 International
Conference on Accelerator and Large Experimental Physics Control Systems.

These papers are also available via anonymous ftp to ftp.ee.lbl.gov;

This release includes user documentation, which can also be retrieved
separately from ftp.ee.lbl.gov as glish/USER-DOC-2.3.ps.Z.
