------------------------------------------------------------------------

Glish is a language, interpreter, and class library for building
loosely-coupled distributed systems. Glish implements a "software bus"
to which processes are connected and controlled by the Glish scripting
language. The Glish C++ class library provides the tools necessary for
processes to connect the software bus and exchange structured binary
data. If you would like more information, please see the Glish home
page:                           http://www.cv.nrao.edu/glish/

If you have trouble installing Glish or have questions, please check the
Glish home page (see URL above); it has information about Glish and who
to contact with questions or bug reports.

A Glish email exploder list is available, and it is probably the best way
to keep up to date on future Glish releases. You can subscribe to it by
sending email to:               majordomo@majordomo.cv.nrao.edu
with the message contents:      subscribe glish

A few introductory papers and the Glish "User Manual" can be found in
the directory glish/doc.
