Glish is a language, interpreter, and class library for building
loosely-coupled distributed systems. Glish provides a "software bus"
to which processes are connected and controlled by the intrepreted
Glish scripting language. The Glish C++ class library provides the tools
necessary to exchange structured binary data among the processes on the
software bus. If you would like more information, please see URL:
