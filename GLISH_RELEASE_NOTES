This is Glish version 2.4.1, dated 13Oct93.

This release includes Postscript for a new overview paper describing
how Glish is used for accelerator control; support for "request/reply"
events; and a couple of bug fixes.  See glish/Changes for details.

There's a bug fix for InterViews 2.6 which you should apply if you use
point-to-point links (even if not you should apply it, as it can bite you
in other ways).  See the top-level file "InterViews-sensor.patch".  (This
patch was first introduced with the 2.2.2 release, so you may have already
made it.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Glish is a language, interpreter, and class library for building
loosely-coupled distributed systems.  For an overview from a general
computing perspective, see the paper ``Glish: A User-Level Software
Bus for Loosely-Coupled Distributed Systems,'' in the Proceedings of
the 1993 USENIX Winter Technical Conference.  For an overview from
an accelerator control perspective, see the paper ``Glish: A Software
Bus for High-Level Control,'' to appear in the proceedings of the
1993 International Conference on Accelerator and Large Experimental
Physics Control Systems.

These papers are also available via anonymous ftp to ftp.ee.lbl.gov;
retrieve glish/USENIX-93.ps.Z and glish/ICALEPCS-93.ps.Z, respectively.

This release includes user documentation, which can also be retrieved
separately from ftp.ee.lbl.gov as glish/USER-DOC-2.3.ps.Z.

Glish users are encouraged to make themselves known by sending email to
vern@ee.lbl.gov; that way we can keep you informed of bug fixes, new
releases, and the like.


Installing Glish
----------------

The Glish system comes in two directories, "sds" and "glish".  To build the
system you need a C++ compiler, sockets, and an ANSI C compiler.

1.  You need to set a number of environment variables to configure
    the installation.  Source'ing the script "glish-env" sets these
    to default values, which you may need to change.  The variables are:

	ISTKPLACE
		The directory where you want to install the system.
		Default: "/usr/local/src/ISTK".  You will at some point
		want to move the contents of the Glish release into
		this directory, so that, for example, this file is 
		$ISTKPLACE/GLISH_RELEASE_NOTES, and the glish sources
		are $ISTKPLACE/glish.

	CC
		Name of an ANSI C compiler.  Default: "gcc"

	CPLUS
		Name of C++ compiler.  For example, "g++" or "CC".
		Default: "g++"

	LEX
		Should be set to "flex".  If you do not have "flex"
		you need to install it.  You can retrieve the latest
		version from ftp.ee.lbl.gov (flex-2.3.7.tar.Z).

	CFLAGS
		Flags used for compilation.  Default: "-g".

	ARCH
		The architecture of the machine for which you're building
		the system.  Default: "SUN4".

	ISTKBIN
		Where the glish executables will reside.  Should be
		$ISTKPLACE/bin/$ARCH.

	ISTKLIBS
		Where the sds and glish libraries will reside.  Should
		be $ISTKPLACE/lib/$ARCH.

	AR
		Set to "ar".

	RANLIB
		Set to "ranlib" for systems with "ranlib", "echo" otherwise.

	CP
		Set to "cp -p" for systems whose "cp" has a "-p" flag,
		otherwise "cp".

	MAKE
		If your "make" tool does not automatically define the "MAKE"
		variable, set it to "make".


2.  Create the directory $ISTKPLACE and cd to it.  If not already there,
    move the glish/ and and sds/ trees that came with the distribution
    into $ISTKPLACE.


3.  Create bin, lib, bin/$ARCH, lib/$ARCH, include, include/Glish,
    and include/Sds directories.


4.  Create glish/$ARCH, glish/clients/$ARCH, and sds/$ARCH subdirectories.


5.  Change directory to $ISTKPLACE/sds and type "make install-all".


6.  Change directory to $ISTKPLACE/glish and type "make install-all".


7.  At this point Glish should be installed in $ISTKLIBS and $ISTKBIN.
    You can test it by running it on the files demos/test{1,2,3}.g.
    The first should just print the numbers from 1 to 10; the second
    should print the current date; and the third should print the
    numbers from 1 to 5, pausing after each the same number of seconds
    (for example, after it prints 3 it should pause 3 seconds).
